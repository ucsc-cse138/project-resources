# Overview

This repository contains (or will contain) simple static resources for students to use in assignments. The idea is that we can
make automatic testing easier (or less fragile?) if we simply consolidate string literals and similar resources in this
repository because it will make diffs between actual output and expected output less likely to differ on silly typos. This
hopefully gets us closer to simply grading program logic of student's programs rather than whether they can type exact
capitalization and spelling from the specs.

# Status

The contents of this repository are still a work in progress, and are not yet made available (or at least announced) to
students. This is an experimental idea that still requires buy in from other TAs and instructors.
